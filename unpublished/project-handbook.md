## [TBD]
The guidelines for this project handbook are as follows: 

    * The handbook should be a how-to and guidance document.  The project policy document should contain policy.
    * Similarly to the above, there should be no duplication of policies which are in other documents (provide links to those policies)
    * It should be the same as the Chapter Handbook(chapter handbook is being worked by the Chapter Committee) as possible and only different where necessary.
    * Similarly, if there are 'Leader' policies that can be removed from the Chapter Handbook and Project Handbook, those should go in a separate Leaders policy document (and be referenced by link in the Chapter/Project Handbook)
    * All content should be available online; there should be no PDF or other 'hardcopy'
