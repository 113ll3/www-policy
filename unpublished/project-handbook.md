title: Project Handbook (Draft WIP)
layout: col-sidebar

---

## [TBD]
The guidelines for this project handbook are as follows:
    * There should be no duplication of policies which are in other documents (provide links to those policies)
    * It should be as much the same as the [Chapter Handbook](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapter-handbook-existing.md) as possible and only different where necessary
    * Similarly, if there are 'Leader' policies that can be removed from the Chapter Handbook and Project Handbooks, those should go in a separate Leaders Handbook (and be referenced by link in the Chapter/Project Handbook)
    * All content should be available online; there should be no PDF or other 'hardcopy'
