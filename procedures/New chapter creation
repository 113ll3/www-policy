Issues with current policies that are blockers, risks, or issues:

* Blockers - the policy says something that we really can't do, such as keeping PII on minors, etc. 
* Risks - e.g. if too many people take advantage of this process, we'll go broke, damage our reputation risk, legal liability, etc
* Issues - the policy describes something that we shouldn't do, or there's conflicting statements on two different policies, and we want to stop folks from choosing their own policy, or forcing us to reverse our decision, or we can't manage to policy.
