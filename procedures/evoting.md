## eVote procedure

1. A Board member will sponsor a motion to be put to an e-vote
2. The Board member will ask for a second in the public Google group or, if sensitive, private Board communications with all Board members and the Executive Director included
3. If a second is found, the discussion period of 7 days will start
4. The Executive Director will create an e-Vote with the motion with a 7 day timer.
5. Board members have 7 days to complete their vote. They may choose to not vote, or vote to abstain, no, or yes. They can re-cast their votes if they change their mind, but only one vote per Board member will count, and tallied at the end of the e-Vote period
6. Quorum must be reached (4/7) for the vote to be valid by Board members voting in some manner, with a super majority (5/7) if the matter is to alter a bylaw or policy. Not voting does not count towards quorum.
7. At the end of the 7 days, the Executive Director will close the e-Vote, and let the Board know the result. 
8. The Executive Director will provide minutes to the Operations Manager to be included in the next month's general meeting, or if a sensitive matter, in a private Board setting agreed to by the Board.
9. Any operational actions arising from the motion being passed will then be scheduled by the OWASP Foundation.
