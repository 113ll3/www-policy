## SLA Response to all JIRA tickets requests is 144 working hours; pauses when ticket is set to "Waiting for Customer Response"

Issue: Membership policy does not address what happens to a complimentary membership if a leader steps down or the chapter is deemed inactive. 
OWASP.org email addresses deactivation did not follow a consistant policy when membership or leadership ended. This was and still is manual process.
