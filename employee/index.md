The latest approved OWASP Foundation Employee Handbook can always be found in the [Insperity HR portal](https://insperity.com). This is the only valid version of the Employee Handbook.

Insperity HR manages the Employee Handbook for OWASP and ensures that it is in full compliance with all relevant US Government (state and federal) laws and regulations, as well as managing our leave policies, benefits, and other employment perks and conditions unique to OWASP. It contains a staff whistleblower process, amongst many other provisions.
