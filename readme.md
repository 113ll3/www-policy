This is the policy repository for the OWASP Foundation

Policies approved by the board are marked as such. Policies that are a Work in Progress are marked as Draft - WIP. OWASP Members are invited to provide feedback on the draft policy until the date indicated on the policy. The Policy Review Team will respond to comments mailed from your owasp.org email address to [this address](mailto:policy-review@owasp.com). Mailing the policy review team while a policy is in draft form is the only official method of providing feedback about the policy. Issues and PRs against a draft policy are for official Foundation use only so please provide only email feedback.

Any spelling or grammatical corrections against already approved policies can be suggested via PR or github issues.
