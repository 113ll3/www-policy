## Community Engagement
The purpose of this page is to outline how OWASP Community Leaders can request funding to support the mission of OWASP. If you can't find what you are looking for, please [Contact Us](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/72).

Successful global outreach and community support are critical activities that support our purpose of driving visibility and evolution of safety and security of the worlds software.  To this end, some guidelines have been established for the OWASP community leadership to follow as they support the OWASP Foundation and itâ€™s core purpose.

## Process

1. First check the Chapter and "Project Funding Totals" below under "Additional Resources" to make sure you know what is in your Project or Chapter's available funds
2. Ready to make a request? [Request Funding Pre-Approval](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/14)
3. Already approved? Submit receipts for reimbursement with our [Reimbursment Submission Form](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/9)

**Please note:  Requests are reviewed within 72 hours.  Payments are made twice per month and may take up to 22 days depending on time of submission.**

## Types of Activity Supported

The Board of Directors approved a motion at the October 14, 2015 board meeting that any request for funding that has been approved for one chapter or project, can be considered an acceptable expense for all chapters or projects. If you have an account balance which covers that expense in full, then the item should be considered pre-approved for spending.

See '''[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Community_Engagement_-_Payments Community Engagement Payments]''' for a list of previously approved expenses. If you do not see a comparable expense or expense category or aren't sure your expense is pre-approved, you must submit a request for approval via the [Request Funding Pre-Approval](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/14) form before requesting reimbursement.
