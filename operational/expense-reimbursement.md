# Expense Policy

## Overview

In the course of fulfilling the mission and business interests of the OWASP Foundation, members, staff, and partners will incur expenses that may be reimbursable. Generally, the policy of the Foundation is that all expenses should be "fair and reasonable" as measured by leadership, the community, and the standards for non-profit foundations.

It the responsibility of those incurring expenses to obtain pre-approval of any planned expense likely to exceed $2,500 and failure to do so may result in your reimbursement request being denied. When any expenses other than airfare is expected to exceed $5,000, an invoice must be requested from the vendor so the Foundation can remit payment directly.

## Travel

Good business judgment is always expected when determining the need to travel on behalf of the Foundation where reimbursement is expected. 

The OWASP Foundation will reimburse travel expenses incurred on behalf of the Foundation for staff, Board members when traveling to Board Meetings and OWASP Global AppSec conferences, and approved OWASP conference keynote speakers for their respective speaking opportunity.  Travel which is explicitly not reimbursable includes leaders or members attending OWASP Conferences unless as a keynote speaker or in an official capacity as a Director of the Foundation.

Travel expenses include, but are not limited to economy airfare, or premium economy if the flight is greater than seven hours, ground transportation, parking, food & beverage, lodging, and other daily business-related expenses. When arranging airfare for extended trips, including a weekend night stay at the convenience of the Foundation may result in a cost savings. Extra lodging expenses in these particular extended trip cases may be reimbursable and require pre-approval with additional documentation. 

In cases where lodging is pre-arranged and direct billed by the Foundation as part of a room block, reimbursement requests for alternative lodging will be denied. Travel benefits are not transferable.

## Reimbursement Process

Expenses, along with receipts for reimbursement, shall be submitted through JIRA for processing and payment. Bundling complete trip expenses into one submission is preferred. When submitting expenses for travel, please subtotal amounts for Transit (Air/train/taxi), Lodging, and Meals. Reimbursement requests must be submitted within 60 days of the expense. The target Service Level Agreement (SLA) for expense reimbursement is 22 days provided the information submitted is complete and accurate. Special attention should always be noted for payment instructions.

The OWASP Foundation does not condone the consumption of alcohol and expects its staff, members, and partners to use good judgment when entertaining. Alcohol expenses are reimbursable when part of a food bill provided the alcohol costs are no more than 50% of the total reimbursable request.

Our policies explicitly prohibit expenses and reimbursement behavior that personally enrich its Board, leaders, members, staff, or partners. It is a very serious matter if you record false or misleading information on expense reimbursements. You may not request reimbursement for expenses that you did not have or that were not business-related.  

## Travel Assistance Programs

From time to time, the OWASP Foundation will budget funds for leaders and members to travel while furthering the mission of the Foundation. All travel reimbursed through the Travel Assistance Program must be pre-approved. The Executive Director along with the Treasurer will define the requirements and limits, along with the process for participating in these programs. 

## Hardware

Capital asset purchases for chapters and proejcts is strongly discouraged and if over $250 requires pre-approval. The primary reason for this policy is the complexity of warehousing and asset tracking. Capital assets under $2,000 purchased by the Foundation will be expensed and not amortized.
