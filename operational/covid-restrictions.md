## Background

OWASP has a responsibility to provide its community and staff with a safe environment, promote chapter, project and committee mission related activity, and to be financially responsible. The following restrictions are in place until they are all lifted. All of these sections have a exceptions to the rule, so please don't assume that something can't happen, please talk to us about your region's COVID situation.

With the recent availability of various vaccines for COVID, we are starting to see a tremendous drop in both hospitalizations and deaths in some countries. We look forward to welcoming back in person physical events, including LASCON later in 2021. However, with some locales and states relaxing necessary health guidance too quickly, hospitalizations and deaths are increasing again. The physical event section has been updated include the requirements to screen attendees and follow CDC guidelines on a global basis unless you're in an all but COVID free region, such as Australia or New Zealand.

### tl;dr

Safety is paramount, with activity and financial health as secondary concerns. The following restrictions will apply until further notice, and reviewed regularly.

- **Virtual events remain the preferred method of meeting** OWASP provides free access to virtual meeting rooms, training, and webinar facilities for up to 1000 attendees at no cost to chapters, events, and training programs. You can obtain these via submitting a non-funding request ticket at [https://contact.owasp.org](https://contact.owasp.org)
- **Physical gatherings must follow US CDC guidelines** This is non-negotiable, and is required for us to safely open back up. We choose the US CDC guidelines to apply globally as we can't have 200+ different guidelines, some of which are not based on health or science. Using a single guideline is the easiest way to ensure your physical gathering will not create undue risk for yourself, your attendees, and OWASP as a whole. See below if you want to meet physically
- **Chapter related expenses are \$250, over \$250 requires pre-approval, and will only be approved for chapter, project, committee or event related expenses**. The [draft Grants policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/grants) might be a better choice for you
- **No monthly, software, periodic or subscription event space, or other recurring payments are permitted** as OWASP's income is down over 80% compared to 2019
- **Travel expenses require pre-approval.** Travel is extraordinarily unlikely to be approved due to OWASP's financial position. See below for more details if you want to travel.

## Running a physical event

We all want to welcome back physical gatherings, such as chapter meetings, local activities or events, and regional conferences. However, OWASP cannot obtain COVID insurance at any price, and as such as cannot offer you coverage if you or someone at your meeting becomes unwell, hospitalized, or dies. Therefore, we must take all precautions necessary to prevent a COVID super-spreader event that could lead to significant and costly illness or indeed death.

- **Follow [US CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html) for physical gatherings** Some states, regions, and countries have relaxed COVID safe health mandates far too early for non-health / non-science reasons and are seeing a resurgence in COVID cases and deaths, and associated hard lockdowns as a direct result. The only way we can safely re-open in 2021 is by demonstrating we have a COVID plan, are following best practices, and allow for contact tracing if the worst happens. As a result, OWASP physical gatherings must follow [US CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html) and not local, regional, or state guidelines unless your state, region, or country is all but COVID free, such as Australia or New Zealand
- **Masks, [temperature and symptom checks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), social distancing, and PPE provision (masks, sanitizer, wipes, etc), are mandated at OWASP events** - unless your country or region is COVID free (NZ, Australia, etc). OWASP has a [standard screening checklist](TBA) which should be used at the physical entry to screen arriving attendees before they enter the event proper. Screeners should have no known underlying conditions or be at higher risk for COVID where possible. OWASP encourages screeners and meeting organizers to get vaccinated as soon as they can
- **Contract Tracing** You must have a record of attendees to allow contact tracing in case of being notified by an individual that they became unwell during or after the event. You must not allow anonymous or unknown individuals to attend, so RSVPs are required to attend all OWASP physical events for the forseeable future. Meetup Pro RSVPs are an acceptable method of tracking attendance. If you do not use Meetup Pro, you are required to demonstrate that you can contact all attendees of your events
- **If someone becomes unwell** If someone becomes unwell at an event, seek medical assistance as necessary. At or immediately after the event inform all RSVP'd attendees that they may have come in contact with an unwell person, and advise everyone to isolate and get tested as soon as possible. You MUST inform the Foundation of this as we may need to assist local authorities with contact tracing
- **No medical records** DO NOT KEEP medical records - OWASP has no method of safely storing sensitive personal health information. You should not record anyone's status, and you should not seek medical information from attendees other than asking them from a printed checklist. This with either result in them being able to attend or leaving the event.
- **Regularly clean the event location** Work with the event location to ensure that the CDC guidelines for cleaniless are followed. If the event location does not provide these services, particularly around bathrooms, please either choose another location that does, or alternatively, please follow the CDC guidelines for regular cleaning and disinfecting high touch surfaces, such as podiums and registration desks.
- **Refunds for paid events if unwell** If an attendee has paid an event fee to attend a physical event, and fails either the temperature check or the screening questions come back as "at risk" for COVID per the symptom checklist, they must not enter or attend the event. Please do not let the attendee enter the event, and ask the attendee to go home,  isolate and get tested as soon as practically possible. If they leave voluntarily, please work with the Foundation to redund their event fee in full. Please respect the individual's privacy as much as you can in these interactions and emails - do not post to public lists or similar
- **No refund for refusing screening, refusing to follow these guidelines, or improperly or not wearing a mask** If an attendee chooses to not follow guidelines, refuses screening, or refuses to wear a mask over the mouth and nose, they must be refused entry and they are not eligible for an event fee refund if one was charged. This should be made clear in the event details and in the RSVP for the event. Event organizers must ask attendees who do not follow guidelines or mask mandates to leave, and can do so at any time during the event, for example if they remove their masks after entry. If they refuse to leave, please work with your local authorities - in most countries, refusing to leave a private property or event is considered trespass rather than a mask or health issue, so please report it as such to the local authorities. Do not touch or get physically involved with the individual, let the authorities handle the situation. If the person cannot be removed, the meeting must end and make it clear to all attendees why the event is ending. Work with the Foundation to reschedule and/or refund the event.
- **No COVID event insurance** Physical gatherings are held at your own risk, and all participants must also agree to that. Please make sure that you put this in the event RSVP to gather acceptance from participants and make an announcement at the start of each event so folks can leave if they don't feel comfortable.  

## Travel is extremely discouraged

Do not make plans to travel. Pre-appoval will require that you demonstrate the following:

- You have obtained sponsorship for all travel and incidental costs (if any)
- You have demonstrated that your travel plans and destination have no travel restrictions, such as driving to an event in a COVID free country, domestic travel with no travel restrictions or differences in COVID status, or that there's a travel bubble between your departure location and destination
- That you agree that all expenses related to delays, increased unforeseen costs, cancellations, airline insolvancy, mandatory quarantine or isolation, medical expenses, medical evacuation, lingering illness, death or similar are explicity excluded and will not be pre-approved or paid.
- Many countries require vaccination and/or a COVID-negative PCR test to travel, as well as a quarantine period. OWASP cannot waive these requirements. Costs relating to vaccination, testing, and quarantine  will not be reimbursed and are at your own expense
- You must obtain sufficient travel insurance to cover typical travel insurance cover, including medical evacuation, and death. Travel insurance will only be reimbursed if covered by a sponsorship.

## COVID Temporary Restrictions and Finance Reform Expenses Policy

OWASP is undergoing fundamental finance reform. During 2020, we operated the expense system exactly as we propose the new finance reform will operate. Expenses have a cap of \$250 USD per request and must be related to your chapter, event, committee, or project. [Submit a chapter reimbursement request](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/9) and adhere to the approval guidelines below, and you'll get reimbursed. Expenses over \$250 must be pre-approved by the Foundation, and require two leaders to approve.

### Expense Approval criteria

- Expenses under \$250 do not require pre-approval, and may be submitted by a single leader for any valid chapter, project, committee, or event expense
- Expenses above \$250 USD require pre-approval and dual leader approval (or leader + relevant committee if only one leader). Do not incur expenses over \$250 without pre-approval, as it will not be paid
- Expenses must have a short explanation of why the expenses is relevant to your chapter, project, or event. Good: "*Food & beverage for February 2021 OWASP Sunnydale chapter meeting*." Bad: "*Catering*"
- Expenses must have a receipt or invoice
- Physical gathering event spaces must be per meeting or event only, and be related to an chapter, event, committee, or project
- Shared working spaces will not be reimbursed without pre-approval
- Physical gathering expenses must have occurred to be paid
- Donations, sponsorships, or funding of external organizations require pre-approval, and are unlikely to be approved
- Periodic subscriptions, software subscriptions, physical space subscriptions, or recurring monthly or annual fees of any type are not permitted without pre-approval
- Expenses relating to shared services that the Foundation already provides to leaders, chapters, events, and projects for free cannot be reimbursed, such as Meetup Pro, Github Pro, GSuite Apps, Zoom, and similar.

During COVID, PPE, no touch thermometers, sanitization, and cleaning supplies are a fair and reasonable expense (see below in relation to gaining approval for physical gatherings). If you do not have pre-approval for a physical gathering, no expenses will be paid, including for PPE.

## Pre-approvals in COVID free and low COVID restriction regions

Where your region or country has become either COVID free, has a high vaccination rate, limited COVID cases, or has achieved herd immunity, pre-approvals can be given for either indefinite periods or quarterly pre-approval to avoid having to apply for each and every meeting when the spread of COVID has been successfully curtailed. You must demonstrate that local health authorities have lifted all gathering limits to get indefinite pre-approval.

## Chapter Minimum Activity Requirements

After April 1, 2021, Chapters must meet three times a year to be considered active. Any combination of virtual or physical meetings, local activities, local events, social events, or regional events organized by the chapter leadership will be considered activity as long as it appears either on the Chapter's home page (if not using Meetup), or on their Meetup Pro account.

## Monthly Review of Restrictions

These restrictions will be reviewed by the Executive Director monthly in concert with the OWASP Board. We welcome comment from the community and the OWASP Board on the detail of these restrictions, and any improvements. Please log a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OWASP/www-policy/issues) to suggest a change for the next month.

We will communicate these restrictions and any changes via OWASP's social media, website, leaders list, and the OWASP Community Slack in the #leaders channel and pin.

If this temporary restriction has not been updated in the last 90 days, it is no longer in effect, and standard policies apply.

If you have any questions, please contact Andrew van der Stock, vanderaj@owasp.com to discuss. Office Hours are available in several time zones:
