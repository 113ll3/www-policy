## Background

OWASP is responsible for providing its community and staff with a safe environment, promoting chapter, project, and committee mission-related activity, whilst being financially responsible. The following restrictions are in place until they are all lifted. Depending on your country or region, please don't assume that something can't happen. Please talk to us about your region's COVID situation and apply for an exemption if you need one.

With the recent availability of various vaccines for COVID, we are starting to see a tremendous drop in hospitalizations and deaths in some countries, but a worrying trend in other countries. We look forward to welcoming back in-person physical events, including LASCON later in 2021. This month, the physical event section was re-written yet again after consultation with the community to follow local and WHO event guidelines.


### tl;dr

Safety is paramount, with activity and financial health as secondary concerns. The following regularly reviewed restrictions apply until further notice.

- **Virtual events remain the preferred method of meeting** OWASP provides free access to virtual meeting rooms, training, and webinar facilities for up to 1000 attendees at no cost to chapters, events, and training programs. You can obtain these via submitting a non-funding request ticket at [https://contact.owasp.org](https://contact.owasp.org)
- **Physical gatherings are permitted with restrictions** Please see below
- **Chapter-related expenses over \$250 requires pre-approval, and will only be approved for Chapter, project, committee, or event-related expenses**. The [Grants policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/grants) or [applying for a regional event](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/19/create/82) are likely to be better choices for larger expenses
- **No monthly, software, periodic, or subscription event space, or other recurring payments are permitted** as OWASP's income is down over 80% compared to 2019
- **Travel expenses require pre-approval.** Travel is extraordinarily unlikely to be approved due to OWASP's financial position. See below for more details if you want to travel.

## Running a physical event

After rapid and widely misunderstood changes in the US Government's CDC mask guidance for vaccinated individuals, and with this advice not applying to unvaccinated individuals or indeed most of the world, it became clear that adhering to CDC guidelines was confusing and not applicable to most of our chapters. As a result, I consulted with OWASP leaders on the best way forward. Thank you for those who us come up with a new approach:

As of June 1, 2021, if you want to hold an in person meeting, and you feel safe in doing so (such as you're fully vaccinated or you live in a country with low or no COVID), you can hold physical meetings, provided that you:

- Always check local regulations before scheduling or holding an event. Only go ahead with the event if it is permitted and adhere to local regulations requirements for event sizes, social distancing, and PPE requirements. If there are none, please follow [WHO COVID small event guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-small-public-gatherings)
- Prefer small outdoor gatherings with social distancing of 1 to 2 metres
- In the RSVP, make it clear that masks should be worn, particularly in places where vaccination status cannot be determined (see below) and entrance is only after screening procedures
- Stay home if you feel unwell. Ask attendees to do the same
- Continue to livestream (hybrid) meetings online, so that people do not wish to attend, or cannot attend in person, can still participate

### RSVP waiver question

Please add the following text as an RSVP question in Meetup: "If attending in person, I acknowledge that I do so at my own risk. OWASP recommends all participants be fully vaccinated prior to attending in person events to reduce the risk of severe illness or death." We are working with Meetup to provide something like this as a mandatory button that is compliant with medical privacy rules. 

### Entrance Screening

Where local regulations permit or mandate, you may ask to see vaccination status and/or temperature screen individuals at the entrance, but keep no records. In places, where wearing of masks has been lifted for vaccinated invididuals, you may permit that at your meetings if you can guarantee that all attending are vaccinated. If you can't screen for vaccinated status, please require masking for all attendees to protect unvaccinated individuals from serious illness or death.

If your region, state, or country prohibits the use of vaccine passports or showing of vaccination records, OWASP strongly recommends against holding in-person meetings. Under no circumstances, do not get into confrontations. If you feel unsafe, please call law enforcement immediately. If you still choose to go ahead, social distancing and masking is mandatory for all in these regions or states regardless of vaccination status to protect all attendees.

In all cases, do not record or store any medical data. OWASP cannot securely or compliantly hold medical records or status.

### For countries without COVID

For countries, such as Australia and New Zealand with no or very limited COVID cases, you can hold meetings and events per local regulations. Please keep on checking local regulations, such as the late May 2021 lockdown in Melbourne as a response to a small number of cases, which obviously means no meetings.

## Expense Approval criteria

- Expenses under \$250 do not require pre-approval and may be submitted by a single leader for any valid chapter, project, committee, or event expense with a valid receipt
- Expenses above \$250 USD require pre-approval, dual leader approval (or leader + relevant committee if only one leader), and a valid receipt. Unapproved expenses above $250 will not be paid
- Expenses must have a short explanation of why the expenses are relevant to your Chapter, project, or event. Good: "*Food & beverage for February 2021 OWASP Sunnydale chapter meeting*." Bad: "*Catering*"
- During COVID, PPE such as disposable masks, no-touch thermometers, sanitization, and cleaning supplies are fair and reasonable expenses when holding physical events
- Physical gathering event spaces must be per meeting or event only and be related to a chapter, event, committee, or project
- Shared working spaces will not be reimbursed without pre-approval
- Physical gathering expenses must have occurred to be paid
- Donations, sponsorships, or funding to external organizations require pre-approval and are unlikely to be approved
- Periodic subscriptions, software subscriptions, physical space subscriptions, or recurring monthly or annual fees of any type are not permitted without pre-approval
- Expenses relating to shared services that the Foundation already provides to leaders, chapters, events, and projects for free cannot be reimbursed, such as Meetup Pro, Github Pro, GSuite Apps, Zoom, and similar
- Expenses relating to vaccination, testing, or quarantine will not be reimbursed and are at your own expense.

If you do not have pre-approval for a physical gathering, no expenses will be paid, including for PPE.

## Travel is unnecessary and discouraged

Do not make plans to travel. Pre-approval will require that you demonstrate the following:

- You have obtained sponsorship for all travel and incidental costs (if any)
- You have demonstrated that your travel plans and destination have no travel restrictions, such as driving to an event in a COVID free country, domestic travel with no travel restrictions or differences in COVID status, or that there's a travel bubble between your departure location and destination
- That you agree that all expenses related to delays, increased unforeseen costs, cancellations, airline insolvency, mandatory quarantine or isolation, medical expenses, medical evacuation, lingering illness, death, or similar are explicitly excluded and will not be pre-approved or paid.
- Many countries require vaccination or a COVID-negative PCR test to travel, as well as a quarantine period. OWASP cannot waive these requirements. 
- You must obtain sufficient travel insurance to cover typical travel insurance cover, including medical evacuation or death. Travel insurance will only be reimbursed if covered by sponsorship.

## Monthly Review of Restrictions

These restrictions will be reviewed by the Executive Director monthly in concert with community and the OWASP Board. We welcome comments from the community and the OWASP Board on the detail of these restrictions and any improvements. Please log a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OWASP/www-policy/issues) to suggest a change for the next month.

We will communicate these restrictions and any changes via OWASP's social media, website, leaders list, and the OWASP Community Slack in the #leaders channel and pin.

If this temporary restriction has not been updated in the last 90 days, it is no longer in effect, and standard policies apply.

If you have any questions, please contact Andrew van der Stock [andrew.vanderstock@owasp.com](mailto:andrew.vanderstock@owasp.com) to discuss.
