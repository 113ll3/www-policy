## Overview
The OWASP Foundation is a U.S. 501(c)3 and accepts gifts through its website and via postal mail. Online gifts are processed from the OWASP website by clicking the DONATE button using Stripe as the backend credit card transaction processor. Various business logic has been coded into this form including:

- Referring page titles for Chapters and Projects are used for gift attribution
- Currency support for US Dollar, British Sterling, and EU Euros
- Restricting gifts are only supported for amounts greater than $1,000
- Additional confirmation is required to process a Restricted Gift

The website DONATE form is the sole online option for the processing and collection of gifts.

## Unrestricted Gifts
Generally, all chartible gifts to the OWASP Foundation are unresticted and will be used at the sole discretion of the organization to fulfill its mission and objectives. Donors have the option to be listed as a Supporter of a Project or Chapter; however, this option does not restrict the gift in anyway whatsoever.

## Restricted Gifts
Gifts greater than $1,000 can optionally be Restricted. This practice is discouraged becuase of the internal accounting responsibilities for a restricted gift. Donors can indicate their restriction at the time of their online donation provided they visited the donation form by clicking the DONATE button on the respective Project, Chapter, or Group. Restricted gifts are net 15% administration and processing costs. Unspent Restricted gift balances become unrestricted at the end of each calendar year.

## Attribution
As noted above, the Donate Form will present donors with the option to be publicly listed as a supporter of the referring Project, Chapter, or Group page. By checking this option on the Form, once a donation has been made, the donor's NAME will be appended to an online donor page for that group's respective website repository. The placement of the donors name into the online donor's file is automatic, but the group Leader will need to approve the release of that information.

## Recognizing Supporters

Projects and Chapters may recognize individuals and corporations that have provided substantive support on the project or chapters' respective web page provided this recongnition is on a "Acknowledgements" or "Supporters" tab. In addition to listing supporters, this tab must also include "The OWASP Foundation is very grateful for the support by the individuals and coporations listed. However please note, the OWASP Foundation is strickly vendor neutral and does not endorse any of its supporters.""

## Grants

Sustaining Gifts and Grants are welcomed. Please Contact Us for more information.
