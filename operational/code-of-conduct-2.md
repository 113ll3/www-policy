## Sanctions

If the Code of Conduct is violated, the following will occur:

### For First Time Breaches that are Less Severe (as determined by the Executive Director):

The participant can agree to sign an Acknowledgement Statement acknowledging that the participant has read the Code of Conduct and that continued participation or Membership of OWASP requires compliance with the Code of Conduct and comply with a temporary suspension of all OWASP participation for a period of no more than 30 days, depending on the severity of the breach. If agreed and signed, the matter will be considered over at the end of the suspension period. The Acknowledgement Statement and record of suspension will be kept for future reference and destroyed after three years. If the participant is a Member, membership will not be extended to cover the suspension period.

### For Failures to Follow Sanctions, Serious First Time Breaches, or Repeated Breaches:

In the event (i) the participant does not follow the penalties imposed for lesser breaches (for example, participant does not agree to sign an Acknowledgement Statement), or (ii) for repeat or serious breaches of the Code of Conduct, or (iii) whenever a person is charged with a crime punishable by more than one year in prison, the Executive Director must suspend the Member, immediately refer the matter to the Compliance Committee, who will make an independent evaluation on if the Board should strip leadership, revoke participation, or membership privileges at their sole discretion. The period of suspension will remain in place until after the Board votes on the matter.

If the Board decides to take no action, full participation can resume immediately. If the participant is a Member, their membership will be extended by the period of the suspension served.

## Transparency and Oversight

To provide transparency and oversight of sanctions, the Executive Director will inform the Board privately of the actions being taken under these sanctions, including providing recommendations from the Compliance Committee and scheduling a vote as necessary.
