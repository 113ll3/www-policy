Participation in the OWASP Foundation is conditional upon individuals following the Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct
- Perform all professional activities and duties in accordance with all applicable laws and the highest ethical principles;
- Promote the implementation of and promote compliance with standards, procedures, controls for application security;
- Maintain appropriate confidentiality of proprietary or otherwise sensitive information encountered in the course of professional activities;
- Discharge professional responsibilities with diligence and honesty;
- To communicate openly and honestly;
- Refrain from any activities which might constitute a conflict of interest or otherwise damage the reputation of employers, the information security profession, or the Foundation;
- To maintain and affirm our objectivity and independence;
- To reject inappropriate pressure from industry or others;
- Not intentionally injure or impugn the professional reputation or practice of colleagues, clients, or employers;
- Treat everyone with respect and dignity; and
- To avoid relationships that impair — or may appear to impair — the OWASP Foundation's objectivity and independence.


## Sanctions

If the Code of Conduct is violated, the following will occur:

### First time / less severe breaches (as determined by the Executive Director)

The participant can agree to sign an agreement acknowledging continued participation or Membership of OWASP requires compliance with the Code of Conduct and comply with a temporary suspension of all OWASP participation for a period of no more than 30 days, depending on the severity of the breach. If agreed and signed, the matter will be considered over at the end of the suspension period. The agreement will be kept for future reference and destroyed after three years. If the participant is a Member, membership will not be extended to cover the suspension period.

### No Agreement, Serious, or Repeated breaches

Where no agreement is made for lesser breaches, or for repeat or serious breaches of the Code of Conduct, or whenever a person is charged with a crime punishable by more than one year in prison, the Executive Director must suspend the Member, immediately refer the matter to the Compliance Committee, who will make an independent evaluation on if the Board should strip leadership, revoke participation, or membership privileges at their sole discretion. The period of suspension will remain in place until after the Board votes on the matter.

If the Board decides to take no action, full participation can resume immediately. If the participant is a Member, their membership will be extended by the period of the suspension served.

## Transparency and Oversight

To provide transparency and oversight of sanctions, the Executive Director will inform the Board privately of the actions being taken under these sanctions, including providing recommendations from the Compliance Committee and scheduling a vote as necessary.
